      <p>Keto diets, intermittent fasting, conscious eating, veganism and more…All these food trends seem to be taking over the world and the followers of these trends have demonised those of us who enjoy eating out!

        Well, this World Health Day, we want you to know that eating out is not a bad thing! In fact, with just a little conscious effort, you can make your dining out experience a lot healthier without compromising on the experience itself! Just follow these 11 tips!</p>
        <h2>Check the menu online before heading out</h2>
        <p>We know you research every restaurant before actually visiting it. Next time you plan to dine out, don’t just check the ratings and ambience of the place. Take a look at the menu and scan for healthy options. Do they have options for salads? Do they have options of dishes that are grilled, roasted, baked or steamed? Or are only fried, crispy, creamy and rich dishes featured on the menu? This small check before heading out will prepare you mentally to order a healthier option over one that is overly unhealthy. Use the Dineout app to check out the menus of the restaurant you’re planning to visit.</p>
        <h2>Choose your drinks carefully</h2>
        <p>We don’t even realise but a lot of the calories we ingest are through the sugary cocktails and mocktails that we order. Drinking something along with a meal is common but does it really have to be an overly sweet, synthetically flavoured drink? How about ordering a fresh juice without added sugar? Or a lemon soda with just a hint of salt? The best is if you stick to the extremely underrated glass of water</p>
