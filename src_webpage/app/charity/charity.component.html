<h3>Charity events</h3>
<mat-card-content>
<p class="m-16-06"> Hosting a charity event is a great way to get involved with the community. Take Restaurant Barr as an example. In support of The World Wide Fund for Natureâ€™s Australian bushfire campaign, they partnered with other restaurants in Copenhagen (Iluka, Noma, 108) to create a tasting menu with dishes from each of the participating restaurants, and wines from Lieu Dit and Rosforth & Rosforth. 100% of the ticket price went to the fund.</p>
