  Padmanabham is a sneak- peek into the medieval brilliance of Dravidian architecture in Kerala. Housed in a beautifully conceptualized temple against a Mandala artwork, Padmanabham is a culturally rich manifestation inspired from Madurai’s Meenakshi temple and Kerala’s Lord Padmanswamy’s temple. The majestic mandala, the brackets, the columns of Hindu order, and the extensive use of Lotus motifs around the space is symbolic of ‘creation’, usually seen in the famous Lord Padmanswamy’s temple.
